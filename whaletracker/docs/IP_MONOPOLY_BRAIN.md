# IP-Monopoly Brain Specification (Logic of the Moat)

The IP-Monopoly Brain (Innovation Expert) tracks the **"Knowledge Floor"**—the monopolistic power generated by intellectual property and government-validated R&D.

## 🛡️ Core Thesis
Price is a reflection of perception; IP is a reflection of structural reality. A company with a unique patent in a strategic sector (semiconductors, biotech, energy) has a high-optionality upside that standard valuation models miss.

## 📡 Data Sources
*   **USPTO PatentsView API**: Tracking granted patents and assignee velocity.
*   **SBIR.gov API**: Tracking Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and STTR grants. These are "State-Validated Seed" signals.
*   **WIPO**: International IP expansion tracking.

## 🧪 Structural Features
1.  **Patent Velocity**: Number of granted patents per year. Measures the "Moat Expansion rate".
2.  **Grant Intensity**: Total SBIR/STTR funding / Market Cap. This is a "Validation Signal"—the government is paying for the company's R&D, de-risking the seed.
3.  **Monopoly Moat Growth**: Year-over-year acceleration in IP filings relative to competitors in the same sector.
4.  **Tech Criticality Score**: Encoded value of the patent category (e.g., Solid State Batteries > iPhone and Case designs).
5.  **Innovation R&D Efficiency**: Ratio of successful patent grants to estimated R&D burn.

## 🤖 Decision Policy
*   **Monopoly Hunter**: Prioritizes micro-caps where the IP value exceeds the current market capitalization (Hidden Value).
*   **The Seed Validator**: Validates "Micro-Lottery" tickets by ensuring the company isn't just a shell but possesses "Structural Brains" (IP).
