# Network-Force Brain Specification (Logic of Influence)

The Network-Force Brain (Whale Expert) tracks the **"Information Floor"**—the collective intent of insiders, activist funds, and corporate "kingmakers."

## 🐋 Core Thesis
Before a structural change becomes public news, it manifests as a **Cluster of Intent**. When multiple "Whales" (Strategic or Institutional) buy into a micro-cap simultaneously, it indicates that the "Information Asymmetry" is at its peak.

## 📡 Data Sources
*   **SEC EDGAR (Form 4, 13D, 13G, 13F)**: The "Gold Standard" of capital intent.
*   **OpenInsider**: Real-time cluster detection.
*   **WhaleWisdom**: Institutional drift and concentration tracking.

## 🧪 Structural Features
1.  **Whale Momentum (Cluster Intensity)**: Number of unique buyers (Insiders + 5% Owners) in a 30-day window.
2.  **Cluster Quality**: Diversity of the buyers. 3 different VPs buying is good; 1 CEO + 1 Activist Fund + 1 Strategic Partner buying is a "Gem Signature."
3.  **Corporate King-Maker Participation**: Identifies if a "Global 500" entity (e.g., Toyota, Google, Lockheed) is participating in the round or partnership.
4.  **Institutional Drift**: Detects the first entry of "Smart Money" funds into micro-cap entities.
5.  **Insider Conviction**: Buy size relative to the individual's net historical ownership. Is this a "top-up" or a "bet-the-farm" buy?

## 🤖 Decision Policy
*   **The Trigger**: Network signals often act as the "Buy Trigger" for structural gems already identified by the Sovereign or IP brains.
*   **Conviction Scaling**: Higher network scores increase the "Seed Size" (from 1€ to 5€) within the Micro-Lottery framework.
