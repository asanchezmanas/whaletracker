# Structural Verification: Real-World "Winners" (2015-2025)

This document proves that the **Structural Alpha** signals we are hunting (Patents, Contracts, Whales) are the real "priors" of explosive growth.

---

### ☀️ Example 1: Enphase Energy ($ENPH)
*   **The Transformation**: ~$0.70 (2017) ➔ ~$300 (2021). **+40,000%**.
*   **The Structural Signals (The Detection)**:
    1.  **IP-Monopoly**: 765 patents globally. Critical patents granted in 2015-2019 for microinverter bidirectional power.
    2.  **Sovereign (Strategic)**: Exclusive supply agreements with Global entities (Japan's Eliiy Power in 2015).
    3.  **Network**: Pivot from bankruptcy fear to aggressive institutional accumulation after the Panasonic/SunPower AC module partnerships.

### 🛡️ Example 2: aeroVironment ($AVAV)
*   **The Transformation**: ~$25 (2016) ➔ ~$200+ (2024).
*   **The Structural Signals**:
    1.  **Sovereign**: Decades of SBIR Phase I/II grants for "Switchblade" tech. The "Structural Gem" was the multi-year DoD R&D backlog before the war-driven explosion.
    2.  **IP**: Dominant patent holder in small tactical UAS.

### 🧬 Example 3: IO Biotech ($IOBT)
*   **The Transformation**: Current Micro-cap (~$25M). **Potential Seed**.
*   **The Structural Signals**:
    1.  **IP-Monopoly**: FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation (2024).
    2.  **Structural Status**: Most biotech with this designation get acquired or explode when data readouts confirm the moat. Market cap is currently "Noise."

### 🐋 Example 4: Servotronics ($SVT)
*   **The Transformation**: ~$10 ➔ ~$50 (Takeover). **+400%**.
*   **The Structural Signals**:
    1.  **Network-Force**: Activist entry (13D) documented just before the TransDigm takeover offer.

## 🔍 How we verify the QDN

When we run the 10-year backtest, we will look for these specific "hits":
1.  **Did the model score ENPH > 80 in 2017?** (Signal: Patent density + Strategic partnerships).
2.  **Did the model score SVT > 85 in 2024?** (Signal: Activist 13D filing).
3.  **Did the model veto companies with < 3 months of cash?** (Protecting against "Structural Death").

**If the QDN detects these 'Hidden Pillars' before the market notices the price move, we have a winner.**
